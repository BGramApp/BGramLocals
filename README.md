# Translation

**we have almost 3 files in each folder:**

1. bgram_strings.xml
2. strings.xml
3. ..._ex.xml

**bgram_string.xml** all strings about BGram are here.

**strings.xml** all original telegram strings are here, only 2 strings
removed from strings.xml "**AppName**" and "**AppNameBeta**" they were
moved to **bgram_strings.xml**

**..._ex.xml** is combination of both files.
